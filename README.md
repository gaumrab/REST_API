# REST_API
I am uploading my  REST API project to Git. This API performs fundamental CRUD operations, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. In developing this project, I utilized various npm packages, such as UUID and Method-Override, along with the Express framework to facilitate the functionality.

## Overview
This is my  REST API project, designed to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It serves as a foundational application to understand RESTful principles and API development.

## Features
- **Create**: Add new data entries.
- **Read**: Retrieve existing data.
- **Update**: Modify existing data entries.
- **Delete**: Remove data entries.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express**: Web framework for building APIs.
- **UUID**: Library for generating unique identifiers.
- **Method-Override**: Middleware to support HTTP verbs such as PUT and DELETE.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd your-repo-name

3. Install the dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install

4. Usage
To start the server, run:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The API will be available at http://localhost:3000 (or your specified port).
